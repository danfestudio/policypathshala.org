					<h3>Position: Public Health Officer </h3>
					<p>Background: Public Policy Pathshala (PPP) has partnered with Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), The Asia Foundation – Sub-national Governance Program (SNGP) phase II to promote and strengthen public health system governance at the subnational level with institutionalization of necessary health legislations and capacitating them on their health sector programming and functions to effectively implement the mandates toward improved access to quality public health services. The partnership aims to enhance the support in formulating and implementing health legislations and policies at the subnational level by orienting, capacitating, mentoring, and fostering increased accountability and ownership.</p><p>In recent years, program approaches have also focused on replicating policies across various local governments. This year, the vision plans to build on this work by providing technical expertise and support to ensure effective policy implementation and sustainable governance practices and start our initiative in consolidating the best practices so far.</p><p>This year, the program will support demand-driven technical assistance on essential law and policy formulation under a collaborative approach which includes cost-sharing and cross-learning among the local governments. Included in this will be support for strategic annual planning and budgeting, among stakeholders through expert level.

Additionally, this will be brought about through an embedding process in Public Health Officers to all six SNGP municipalities, mobilization and monitoring of HFOMCs, and promoting interventions in public health concerns. Demanded by all the municipalities appreciating the work PHOs have been doing for over 1.5 years is seen significant for addressing ongoing challenges and building on the progress achieved in health facility and committee mobilization.
